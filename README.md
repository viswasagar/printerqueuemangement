The Printer Queue Management System is a project that simulates how print jobs are handled by a
computer system. In this project, a C program manages the job scheduling and printing process, while a
Python Tkinter interface lets users easily submit and monitor print jobs. The goal is to show how print
jobs can be organized, processed, and tracked in real time using simple operating system techniques.
When a user submits a print job, they provide details like the number of pages, lines, and
characters in the job, as well as a priority level. The system then calculates how long the job should take
by using fixed speeds for printing pages, processing characters, and printing lines. If the estimated time
exceeds a set deadline, the job is rejected so that only tasks that can be completed on time are allowed.
This helps ensure that the printer works efficiently and doesnâ€™t get overwhelmed by jobs that take too
long.
Overall, the project shows that a printer queue can be effectively managed by combining low-level
programming with a user-friendly interface. The system clearly demonstrates operating system concepts
like multitasking, scheduling, and synchronization in a real-world scenario. It also lays a solid foundation
for future improvements, such as implementing more advanced scheduling methods or adjusting resource
allocation when many jobs are in the queue. This project not only provides a practical simulation of a real
printing system but also serves as an educational tool for understanding how operating systems manage
multiple tasks concurrently.
